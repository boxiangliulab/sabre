# Sabre - Single-cell reAd-Backed umi-awaRE phasing


## What is Sabre

Single-cell level haplotype phasing is key to studying clonal hematopoiesis, X chromosome inactivation, RNA editing, mitotic recombination, and somatic mutations. The availability and exponential growth of scRNA-seq data represent a vastly untapped resource for read-backed phasing in single cells. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq’s read structure, high PCR duplication, and low sequencing depth present challenges. We introduce Sabre, a method that accurately infers long-range haplotypes by leveraging the read structure and PCR duplicates unique to scRNA-seq data. Sabre can be utilized in these following three scenarios: 
 * **Germline variants**, where all cells share the same haplotypes; 
 * **Somatic variants**, where haplotypes are shared by mutant cells and their progenies; 
 * **RNA editing variants**, where haplotypes are unique to each cell. Sabre uses ultrafast graph algorithms and is scalable to atlas-scale data with 1M single cells.

 Developed and maintained by [Laurentius](https://github.com/GhostAnderson).

 Runs on `python 3.x`, requires `samtools`, `vcftools`, `bedtools`.

 ### Sabre for scRNA-seq phasing
----

Requires a VCF and BAM, produces a HAPCUT-style output and a phased VCF with computed haplotype phases and result files containing haplotype details, graph connectivities, and read counts. 

**Example input**
----
We highly recommend you to check your environment setup using the provided example data under `example/` directory.

Run command
```Bash
$ cd /path/to/sabre
$ sabre --id test --bam ./example/bam/NA12878.chr5.example.bam --vcf ./example/vcf/NA12878.example.vcf.gz --sample NA12878 --chr chr5 --input_type umitools 
```
If everything was set up right, this command should run with out any error.

For more example inputs and example inputs for `sabre-somatic`, refer to [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRKllOr7AfEYlQeieH-rj6tgVzMQ_2q1?usp=sharing). After downloaded the example input files, try out the given bash scripts to validate the installation of `sabre`.

**BAM input**
----
 
 Sabre supports BAM files generated by various single-cell alignment/analysing tools e.g. cellranger, star-solo, umitools etc, and multiple filtering parameters on BAM file including alignment score and MAPQ.

 Apart from inputing single BAM file using `--bam <path-to-bam>`, we provided a way to input multiple BAM files at once. This will be helpful when mixing different reads from tissures of a common individual, e.g. normal cells and tumor cells.

 First, you need to prepare a `bam.list` file
 ```python
 #bam.list
 <path-to-bam1>,ID1
 <path-to-bam2>,ID2
 ...
 ```
 and use the argument `--bam_list bam.list`. The `ID` column will be append to cell barcodes from corresponding BAM file.

 We defined cell barcode and UMI style of different softwares as follows:
 ```bash
 #Cellranger
SRR8551677.314853539 ... CB:Z:<Barcodes> UB:Z:<UMI> ...

 #UMI-tools
SRR8551677.236615618_<Barcodes>_<UMI> ...

#star-solo
<Barcodes>_<UMI>_AAAAAEEEEE_SRR6750053.36514992 ...
 ```
 You shall specify your input type by using `--input-type <cellranger/umitools/star>`.
 
 Noted that the cell barcode and UMI style may change between different versions of the same software, and there may be more styles out of our selected ones, we present you with `--input-type re`, which allows you to use custom regular expressions to extract UMI and cell barcodes.

 For example, given a BAM file, one line of the BAM file show as
 ```
SRR8551677.64678072     16      chr1    14426   1   ...  BC:ACTACTACT UMI:TAGTAGTGA ...
 ```
 The corresponding regular expression for extract cell barcode and UMI from this BAM is
 ```
 --bc_re "BC:([AGCT]+)" --umi_re "UMI:([AGCT]+)"
 ```
 Further information of regular expression can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp).

We applied multiple threshold on the BAM file to achieve balance between precision and sensitivity, with corresponding argument `--mapq`, `--as_quality` etc. Detailed information can be seen [here](#accuracy--sensitivity-related-options)

**VCF input**
----

Variants pending for phasing are given by VCF files. By providing VCF files using `--vcf`, you should provide the desired sample name in the VCF file with `--sample`.

Sometimes there are no ground truth VCF files, nor is there an existing VCF file for an individual. In other words, you only have the scRNA-seq bam file. Worry not! You can call variants on your own using the following command. 


```bash
$ samtools index <path-to-bam>
$ bcftools mpileup -Ou -f <path-to-genome.fa> <path-to-bam> | bcftools call -mv -Ob -o tmp.bcf
$ bcftools view tmp.bcf -o tmp.vcf
$ bgzip -c tmp.vcf > <your-desired-name>.vcf.gz
$ tabix -p vcf <your-desired-name>.vcf.gz
```
You can perform further filtering on this VCF file or simply indicate `--raw_vcf` and `--vcf_qual <threshold-on-vcf-QUAL>` when using Sabre.


Note that `samtools` and `bcftools` are not optimized for single-cell data. Consider using [Monopogen](https://github.com/KChen-lab/Monopogen), which designed for scRNA-seq data. A typical output of Monopogen is like:
```
├── germline
│   ├── chr1.gl.vcf.gz
│   ├── chr1.gp.vcf.gz
│   ├── chr1.phased.vcf.gz
├── Script
└── somatic
    ├── chr1.allSNVs.csv
    ├── chr1.cell_snv.cellID.csv
    ├── chr1.cell_snv.cellID.filter.csv
    ├── chr1.cell_snv.mat.gz
    ├── chr1.cell_snv.snvID.csv
    ├── chr1.germlineTrioLoci_model.csv

    ├── chr1.SNV_mat.RDS
    ├── LDrefinement_germline.chr1.pdf
    └── svm_feature.chr1.pdf
```

A typical Monopogen output file `chr<X>.putativeSNVs.csv` may look like:

```csv
chr,pos,Ref_allele,Alt_allele,Depth_total,Depth_ref,Depth_alt,SVM_pos_score,LDrefine_twoLoci_score,LDrefine_trioLoci_score,LDrefine_merged_score,BAF_alt
chr1,633887,G,A,329,2,327,0.660488303686431,NA,NA,NA,0.990909090909091
chr1,634012,T,C,2402,2388,14,0.173676949268894,NA,NA,NA,0.00582605076987099
chr1,634133,C,T,431,401,30,0.25421399379009,NA,NA,NA,0.0694444444444444

```
To use Monopogen's output as `sabre`'s input, one should indicate `--mono`. An example command is 
```bash
$ tabix -p vcf <path-to-monopogen-output>/germline/chr1.gp.vcf.gz
$ sabre --id <ID> --bam <path-to-bam> --vcf <path-to-monopogen-output>/germline/<chr>.gp.vcf.gz --mono <path-to-monopogen-output>/somatic/<chr>.putativeSNVs.csv --sample <SAMPLE_NAME> --chr <desired_chr> --input_type <cellranger/umitools/star/re> 
```
If `--mono` is specified, somatic variants and germline variants will be annotated both in `.SABRE` output and output `.vcf` files.

Somatic variants called by Monopogen is filtered in Sabre. Sabre performs filtering on `Depth_ref` with `--mono_ref`, `Depth_cal` with `--mono_alt`, `SVM_pos_score` with `--mono_svm`, `LDrefine_merged_score` with `--mono_ld` and `BAF_alt` with `--mono_baf_u` and `--mono_baf_l`.

Sometimes, the input chromosome may contain the **"_"** character, e.g. mm10_1. To prevent errors, you need to specify `--sep <any-character-you-like-except-from-_-and-:>`. And in other circumstances, the naming style of given BAM file and VCF file may be different. You can use `--chr_vcf <chr-on-VCF-file>` to specify the desired chromosome in the VCF file.

Sabre assumes diploid for input, thus if there are more than one ALT for a input variant, the default parameters would lead to misleading results. If you consider this as unacceptable, or difference between ALT alleles are important in your study, set `--non_binary_variant`. Therefore the Sabre is provided ability to distinguish between different ALT.

**Output**
----
Typical output consists of a single `chr*.SABRE` file. The format of the `chr*.SABRE` is in consistent with HAPCUT and HapTreeX. A typical block of the `chr*.SABRE` is presented as follow
```csv
...
BLOCK: offset: 249337 len: 2 phased: 2 SPAN: 75 correct: 1
0       1       0       chr20   249337  C       G       0|1
1       0       1       chr20   249412  C       T       1|0
****************
```
From left to right, each corresponding column represents umique_id, allele on one haplotype, allele on the other haplotype, chromosome, position, REF, ALT and GT from the input VCF file.

If you would like to output the phased vcf file, you can specify `--output_vcf`. For the output vcf, we added the following fields to phased variants.

* **SG**: Sabre Local Genotype 
* **SB**: Sabre Local Block
* **SI**: Sabre Local Block Index (unique for each block)

A typical output VCF file would be like:
```
...
chr1    1023775 .       G       A       0       PASS    KM=9.62;KFP=0;KFF=0;MTD=bwa_freebayes,bwa_gatk,bwa_platypus,isaac_strelka       GT:SG:SB:SI     0|1:1|0:chr1_1023775_._G_A;chr1_1023789_._G_C;chr1_1023851_._G_A:47820887733280
chr1    1023789 .       G       C       0       PASS    KM=9.61;KFP=0;KFF=0;MTD=bwa_freebayes,bwa_gatk,bwa_platypus,isaac_strelka       GT:SG:SB:SI     0|1:1|0:chr1_1023775_._G_A;chr1_1023789_._G_C;chr1_1023851_._G_A:47820887733280
...
```

If the output of the ALG and the edge information of it is required, specify `--allele_linkage`. The output of edge linkage information between variants of each cell is outputed in `<output_dir>/<id>/cell_allele_connections_chr*.txt`. The typical content of the output file is 

```
barcode var     geno    support
CCACGGAAGACAATAC        chr22_16614653_._C_T,chr22_16614872_._A_T       00      1
TGAGCCGGTTCCCGAG        chr22_16614653_._C_T,chr22_16614872_._A_T       00      1
ACTTACTGTTCCTCCA        chr22_16614653_._C_T,chr22_16614872_._A_T       00      1
...
```

To enable residual graph output, specify `--residual_edges`. The results are stored in `<output_dir>/<id>/singular_cells/singular_cell_linkage_*.txt`. The typical content would be like
```
barcode var     geno    support p-value oppo_support    total_covered_barcodes  global_oppo_support     correct is_singular
CCATTCGCAGGATTGG        chr15_22690417_._A_G,chr15_22690362_._A_G       01      1       0.8607110296641832      0       7       5       1       0
CTCAGAAAGGAATTAC        chr15_22690417_._A_G,chr15_22690362_._A_G       01      1       0.8607110296641832      0       7       5       1       0
```
where `support` represents the number of mRNAs supporting this pair of allele in this specified cell barcode. `oppo_support` represents the number of mRNAs in conflict with this pair in this cell barcode. `total_covered_barcodes` represents the number of cells that expressed this two variants. `global_oppo_support` represents the number of mRNAs in conflict with this pair in all cells.

To perform further somatic mutation analysis with `sabre-somatic`, the user shall indicate `--output_conflict` when calling `sabre`. The output conflict graph is stored in `<output_dir>/<id>/conflicted_graphs/`. Each `.pickle` file contains a `networkx.Graph()` object, user can easily load the graph using `pickle.load()` and perform custom analysis.

For detailed output, and graphical demonstration of ALGs (allele linkage graph), specify `--verbose`. All the conflicted ALGs will be stored in `<output_dir>/<id>/conflict_graphs_graphml/*.graphml`. The resolved conflicted ALGs will be stored in `<output_dir>/<id>/resolved_conflict_graphs_graphml/*.graphml`. The `.graphml` file can be further visualized and analysed using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

 ### Sabre-somatic: Sabre for somatic variation filtering
----
Although Monopogen has provided filtering strategy for filtering somatic mutation callset, there are still quite many sequencing errors hidden in the callset. In `sabre-somatic`, we can utilize the phasing information to refine the somatic mutation callset, as sequencing errors may evenly distributed on both alleles.

To perform somatic mutation filtering, call `sabre-somatic filter` and indicate the `--id` and `--output_dir` if the output directory is not `./output`. A minimal example is

```bash
$ sabre-somatic filter --id <id>
```

This function will generate one output:
- `refined.somatic.mutations.tsv`

An example output is shown below
```tsv
chr19_45523951_somatic_T_A,somatic_mutation
chr12_7920572_somatic_A_G,sequencing_error
chr19_18589308_somatic_A_G,sequencing_error
chr19_8413314_somatic_T_G,sequencing_error
chr19_34860631_somatic_G_C,sequencing_error
chr12_7920565_somatic_A_C,sequencing_error
chr12_7934570_somatic_G_T,sequencing_error
chr19_40799190_somatic_C_G,sequencing_error
chr1_198658531_somatic_T_C,sequencing_error
chr1_1512167_somatic_C_G,sequencing_error
```

 ### Sabre-somatic: Sabre for somatic variation analysis
----

To perform somatic variations analysis in the paper, you first need to specify `--output_conflict` when performing *Sabre* phasing.

To perform **in-phase** and **out-of-phase** detection, user shall first prepare a `gtf` file and run the following command.
```bash
# For somatic variation analysis
$ sabre-somatic run --id <id> --gtf <path-to-gtf> --vcf <path-to-vcf> --chr <chromosome>
```
An example GTF file could be downloaded [here](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/). 

The script will generate two outputs: 
* `chr*.in.phase.hits.annotated.csv`
* `chr*.out.of.phase.hits.annotated.csv`

A typical example of output is
```tsv
sample	germline	somatic	gene	cells	supports
JP_RIK_H012	chr1_226070308_._C_T	chr1_226067274_somatic_T_C	H3-3A	CGGTTAAAGCACCGTC-1_1	1
JP_RIK_H012	chr1_46676803_._A_G	chr1_46677049_somatic_C_T	EFCAB14	AGCTCTCTCATAGCAC-1_1	1
JP_RIK_H012	chr1_46706337_._C_T	chr1_46677049_somatic_C_T	EFCAB14	AGCTCTCTCATAGCAC-1_1	1
JP_RIK_H012	chr1_46718867_._C_T	chr1_46677049_somatic_C_T	EFCAB14	AGCTCTCTCATAGCAC-1_1	1
JP_RIK_H012	chr1_46718524_._A_G	chr1_46677049_somatic_C_T	EFCAB14	AGCTCTCTCATAGCAC-1_1	1
JP_RIK_H012	chr1_149402084_._C_CT	chr1_149471694_somatic_A_G	NOTCH2NLC	GGGAATGTCTCTAAGG-1_1	2
```
where each line represents a in/out-of-phase variant pair. `germline` column represents germline variants, `somatic` column represents somatic variants and `gene` column represents the gene name on which the event occurs. `cells` represents the cell barcodes that harbors the somatic-germline variant pair, and `support` represents the total cell counts.

Notablly, all the germline variants and somatic variants are not filtered by CADD score nor missense/synonymous. User may perform further filtering theirselves.

 ### Sabre for RNA-editing analysis
----

To perform somatic variations analysis in the paper, you first need to specify `--allele_linkage`. 

If `--allele_linkage` is specified, sabre will output variant pairs and its configuation in each cell barcode in `<output_dir>/<id>/cell_allele_connections_<chr>.txt`. A example is shown below

```tsv
barcode var geno    support
TGAAAGATCTGCTGCT    chr22_17113996_._T_C,chr22_17114025_._G_A   00  1
GTCATTTGTGTCCTCT    chr22_17113996_._T_C,chr22_17114025_._G_A   00  1
TCAGGATGTACATCCA    chr22_17115288_._T_C,chr22_17115339_._T_C   11  1
CTCATTATCAACACCA    chr22_17115288_._T_C,chr22_17115339_._T_C   11  1
```
where `barcode` represents a unique cell, `var` represents a variant pair, `geno` represents the configuration of the given variant pairs (`0` represents wild type and `1` represents alternative) and `support` represents the UMI count of the given variant configuration in the given barcode.

After allele linkage information is extracted, we can then perform RNA-editing analysis. 

First, edit sites and potential edQTL sites shall be filtered. We perform this filtering by refering to the GTEx edQTL data. The GTEx edQTL data can be downloaded [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/adult-gtex/bulk-qtl/v8/editing-qtl/GTEx_Analysis_v8_edQTL.tar).

After data preparation and filtered `var` into one RNA-editing site and potential edQTL, you shall count the summation of `support` with different `geno` and same `barcode` and `var`, which represents mRNA count of different configuration of edQTL and editing site pairs.

For example, assume in a certain `cell_allele_connections_<chr>.txt`
```tsv
barcode var geno    support
TGAAAGATCTGCTGCT    <edQTL>,<Editing Site>   00  a
TGAAAGATCTGCTGCT    <edQTL>,<Editing Site>   01  b
TGAAAGATCTGCTGCT    <edQTL>,<Editing Site>   10  c
TGAAAGATCTGCTGCT    <edQTL>,<Editing Site>   11  d
```
those four lines provide us the counting information of a certain pair of edQTL and editing site in a certain cell. We can calculate the editing level of `<edQTL>` on `<Editing Site>` by
```
ref_level = b / a + b
alt_level = d / c + d
```
Furthermore, we can generalize this into a certain cohort by group by the same `var` among all samples and analyze cell type-specific RNA-editing by annotating each barcode with its cell type and group by the annotated cell type. However, as data format and analysis aim may vary drastically for RNA-Editing, we could not provide a standard and generalized analysis pipeline for edQTL analysis. 

The R script used to reproduce the RNA-Editing analysis in the sabre paper is in `example/sabre_rna_editing.R` for reference and further modifications.

We welcome any enquiries on usage of sabre on single-cell edQTL analysis!

* `--mono`: The result putativeSNVs.csv of Monopogen somatic output, used for somatic variation analysis
* `--mono_svm`: Threshold on SVM_pos_score in putativeSNVs.csv. Default: `0.5`
* `--mono_ld`: Threshold on LDrefine_merged_score in putativeSNVs.csv. Default: `0.5`
* `--mono_baf_u`: The upper bound on BAF_alt in putativeSNVs.csv. Default: `0.5`
* `--mono_baf_l`: The lower bound on BAF_alt in putativeSNVs.csv. Default: `0.1`
* `--mono_ref`:Threshold on Dep_ref in putativeSNVs.csv. Default: `5`
* `--mono_alt`: Threshold on Dep_alt in putativeSNVs.csv. Default: `5`


### Sabre-somatic Options
#### `sabre-somatic run`
* `--id`: The ID of `sabre` run.
* `--vcf`: The germline VCF file of sample `id`.
* `--chr`: Indicate the chromosome on which the `sabre-somatic` will be performed on.
* `--output_dir`: If other `--output_dir` is set when calling `sabre`, this should be set as the same `--output_dir` as `sabre`.
* `--gtf`: Input GTF file. We recommend you to input a .gtf file rather than a .gtf.gz file, because sabre-somatic will have to depress the file everytime you input a compressed gtf file, which will result in a waste of time and disk space.
* `--cells`: Threshold on number of supporting cells.
* `--reads`: Threshold on number of supporting reads.

#### `sabre-somatic init`
* `--gtf`: Input GTF file. We recommend you to input a .gtf file rather than a .gtf.gz file, because sabre-somatic will have to depress the file everytime you input a compressed gtf file, which will result in a waste of time and disk space.

#### `sabre-somatic filter`
* `--id`: The ID of `sabre` run.
* `--output_dir`: If other `--output_dir` is set when calling `sabre`, this should be set as the same `--output_dir` as `sabre`.
